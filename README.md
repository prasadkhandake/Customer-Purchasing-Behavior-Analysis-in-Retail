Key insights include:

Geographic Insights: The UK led in both the number of orders and total spending, with the Netherlands and Ireland also ranking high in expenditure.

Customer Behavior: The analysis uncovered that customers often received free items with purchases, though the factors influencing these promotions remain unclear.

Top Performing Countries: The top five countries in order volume were the UK, Germany, France, Ireland, and Spain, with the UK, Netherlands, and Ireland leading in spending.
